Semester Project in collaborations with BMW AG &amp; Technische Hochschule Deggendorf on the topic "Clustering of Fault Message Texts from Machine Equipment"

- The KMeans & DBSCAN folder contains all the files regarding the clustering algorithms.
    - The .csv & .xlsx file contains the cluster labels for all the fault messages.
    - The .png files contain the visualization of the clustering algorithm.
    - The .pkl file contains the model that can be used.
